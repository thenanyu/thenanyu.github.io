<p> Computers gave us the means, but AI gives us the ends</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Jul 2025</em></p>
<p>If you&#39;re a developer from a certain era (i.e. pre-2021), then you&#39;ve grown-up being indoctrinated into the <strong>IT school of thought</strong>. You reflexively see every problem you encounter through the lens of relational databases and form submissions.</p>
<p>You might even judge how &quot;technical&quot; someone is by their ability to massage real-world problems into table schemas and imperative logic.</p>
<p>You probably thought <a href="https://xkcd.com/1425/">this</a> was a funny joke once...</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/ai-brain-xkcd.png" alt="for the first 75 years of computing, this was a good joke" title="for the first 75 years of computing, this was a good joke"></p>
<p>...and for the first 75 years of computing—from 1945 to 2020—it was.</p>
<p>Database lookups were trivial, computer vision was virtually impossible. IT-brained programmers knew this. Ignorant normal people didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>But today you can snap a picture on your phone and <a href="https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/">identify the exact species</a> of bird you just saw, and the best way to know if a picture was taken in a national park isn&#39;t to examine its metadata, but to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts5lPDV--cU">simply ask</a>.</p>
<p>What was virtually impossible became <strong>trivial</strong> in a hurry.</p>
<p>The basic assumptions we had about how computers work have flipped. The IT-indoctrinated brain has always tried to attack messy real-world problems by surrounding them in a logical ring-fence. They hold onto this notion that computers are tools in the same way that shovels and drills are tools. They&#39;re a means to an end. Shovels are a means for making holes in the ground. Drills are means for making <a href="https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/what-customers-want-from-your-products">holes in the wall</a>.</p>
<p>To really take advantage of what AI can do, developers need to start thinking about software differently— not as the means to but as the ends. Don&#39;t deliver tools that allow users to achieve outcomes. Just deliver the outcomes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rather than giving users folders, tags, and naming conventions, you can just understand and organize their content.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rather than asking users to construct state machines and write in DSLs, you can just execute natural-language rules.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Instead of requiring users to learn a templating system and string replacements, you can simply write custom messages en mass.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#39;t make drills or shovels, make holes.</p>
